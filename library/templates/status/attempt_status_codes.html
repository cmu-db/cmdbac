                                The application was successfully deployed and the system was able to run a workload and capture queries.

                            <td>
                                The system failed to download the application's source code from the on-line repository. This could be a transient network error or the application could have been deleted.

                            <td>
                                The application did not contain the necessary files that are needed to deploy and run it. This likely means that the application is not the project type that we assumed that it was. This can occur if the crawler mis-idenfies it as a database application.

                                The deployer was unable to determine what dependencies are needed to automatically deploy the application.

                            <td>
                                The application failed to instantiate and synchronize its database properly. This can occur if there are additional manual steps that are needed prior to deployment.
                            </td>

                            <td>
                                The system was able to install the dependencies needed for the application but then it experienced an unexpected error when trying to actually run it. This could because the application in its current form is broken and is thus not runnable.
