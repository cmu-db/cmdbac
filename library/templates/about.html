        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The goal of the <b>Database Application Catalog</b> project is to find a large amount of database applications to use in various projects, including workload analysis, automatic tuning, and benchmarking. It searches the Internet for web-based database applications and run them locally in order to learn how they use a DBMS.

        <p>The first component is a crawler that finds database applications hosted on open-source repositories (i.e., GitHub). The crawler uses heuristics that allows it to identify whether a project uses a database for storage. We target web-based applications that use well-known web frameworks (i.e., Django, Ruby on Rails). Thus, we can identify whether a project is relevant if its source code references libraries from one of these frameworks.

        <p>We then developed a tool for automatically deploying an application in a VM sandbox. Targeting applications that use the common web frameworks listed above makes this step easier because they provide an object-relational mapping library that does not depend on a particular DBMS. Their configurations are also likely to be the same (e.g. setting the DBMS credentials in a common configuration file).
